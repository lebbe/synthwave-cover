# Synthwave Cover Creator

This is a little web-based tool which makes you create synthwave covers. Everything is done with HTML, CSS and SVG,
and the layout will always fit into a reponsibe 1:1 ratio. 

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of Synthwave Cover Creator to the `build/` folder.


### npm test

Launches the application test runner. I haven't writen any decent tests yet, though. I will as soon as bugs start to crawl out.

Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
